# Installation
 
> First, run `npm install --save @cw-types/mssql`


>Then, you must add `node_modules/@cw-types` to your `tsconifg.json` file, like so:
```javascript
    "typeRoots": [
      "node_modules/@cw-types",
      "node_modules/@types"
    ]
```
> This will enable the Typescript compiler to find and use this typing since it is not installed under `node_modules/@types`.

> Please note the order is important of the entries in `typeRoots`.  If you want `node_modules/@types` to resolve first then move it up top.
